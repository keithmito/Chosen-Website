    <h2>The Power of Guarantors</h2>
    <p>Guarantors (people who vouch for you) provide an extra layer of security for the Sacco. This helps us recover loans in the event of default, protecting our members' investments</p>

    <h2>The Benefits of Cell Groups</h2>
    <p>We understand that finding guarantors can sometimes be a challenge. That's why we created cell groups. These groups, based on shared interests or even location, allow members to support each other as guarantors, opening up more loan opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Make timely loan payments to maintain good standing and keep our Sacco strong. If you're facing trouble, talk to us – we want to help!</p>
